            <title> Warning </title>
            <para> It is VERY IMPORTANT that the configuration of the Manager (or cluster of managers) is performed before configuring FlowGate sensors. </para>
            <para> The Manager must be operational and in a network accessible to the sensors. Some of the sensor configuration processes depend on the access to the Manager. </para>
            <para> It is also IMPORTANT that the FlowGate sensor network is operational during the first boot process. The FlowGate sensor will contact the Manager in order to perform a sensor registration. </para>
